-Security: With the increasing threat of cyber-attacks, software engineering incorporates security measures from the ground up, ensuring that software is robust against vulnerabilities.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)-The term software engineering was first introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968. This conference highlighted the software crisis, where projects were plagued by cost overruns, missed deadlines, and unreliable software. The event led to the formalization of structured programming and software development methodologies to improve reliability and maintainability.
-The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s-1980s)-Before structured programming, software development was often chaotic, with developers writing unorganized and hard-to-maintain code. The introduction of structured programming principles by Edsger Dijkstra promoted a more disciplined approach, emphasizing modularity, control flow, and readability.Languages like C and Pascal became popular for implementing structured programming, improving software quality, and reducing bugs.
-The Agile Revolution (2001-Present)-The Agile Manifesto, published in 2001, transformed how software was developed by emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress. Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban replaced rigid waterfall models, allowing teams to adapt quickly to changing requirements. This shift led to faster development cycles, continuous delivery, and more user-centered software products.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning-Defines project goals, scope, feasibility, and resource allocation.Helps in risk assessment and setting timelines.
2.Requirements Analysis.Gathers and documents functional and non-functional requirements.Involves stakeholders to ensure clarity and completeness.
3.Design-Creates system architecture, database models, and UI/UX designs.Specifies technologies, frameworks, and development methodologies.
4.Implementation (Coding)-Developers write the actual code based on design specifications. Follows best practices, coding standards, and version control.
5.Testing-Identifies and fixes bugs to ensure software reliability and security.Includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.
6.Deployment-Releases the software to users or production environments.May involve staged rollouts, cloud deployment, or on-premise installation.
7.Maintenance & Support-Addresses bugs, updates features, and ensures long-term usability.Provides ongoing technical support and performance monitoring.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

-The Waterfall methodology follows a linear sequence of phases, while Agile breaks the project into smaller, iterative cycles (sprints).
-Waterfall requires all requirements to be defined upfront, while Agile allows changes and refinements throughout development.
-Waterfall delivers the final product at the end of the process, while Agile delivers working increments of the software at regular intervals.
-Waterfall is suitable for projects with well-defined and stable requirements, while Agile is ideal for projects that require flexibility and continuous feedback.
-Waterfall has limited customer involvement after the initial planning phase, while Agile encourages frequent collaboration with stakeholders.
Appropriate Use Cases for Each Methodology
 When to Use Waterfall:
Well-Defined Requirements:
Example: Developing a payroll system where all functionalities are clearly outlined from the start.

Regulatory & Compliance Projects:
Example: Healthcare or financial software that must meet strict government regulations.
Fixed Budget & Timeline Projects:
Example: Building a bridge simulation system where all specifications must be finalized before development begins.

 When to Use Agile:
Dynamic & Evolving Requirements:
Example: A startup developing a mobile app, where new features may be added based on user feedback.

Customer-Centric Products:
Example: An e-commerce platform where frequent updates and enhancements are needed.

 -Enhances Efficiency: Reduces Ambiguity: Clear prompts minimize misunderstandings, reducing the need for repeated queries or corrections.
 -Enables Control Over AI Behavior- Carefully crafted prompts can help prevent the AI from generating irrelevant, biased, or inappropriate content.
 -Supports Complex Tasks- Through Step-by-Step Reasoning, Techniques like chain-of-thought prompting enable the AI to tackle complex problems by breaking them into smaller, manageable steps.
 -Facilitates Customization and Control-Allows users to tailor responses based on tone, depth, and format.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Write a recipe for a dessert."

Improved Prompt
Improved Prompt: "Write a detailed recipe for a classic chocolate chip cookie. The recipe should serve 12 people, include step-by-step instructions, and list all ingredients with precise measurements (in grams and cups). Specify the baking temperature (in Celsius and Fahrenheit) and time, and include tips for achieving a soft and chewy texture."

 Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective
 -Clarity: The updated prompt specifies the sort of dessert (traditional chocolate chip cookie) and the intended audience (12 serves).  This avoids any doubt about the type of recipe needed.

 -Specificity: It describes the particular needs, such as step-by-step directions, precise measures (in grams and cups), baking temperature (in Celsius and Fahrenheit), and baking time.  It also specifies a texture goal (soft and chewy).


- Conciseness: Although the updated prompt is extensive, it is still brief and to the point.  It removes extraneous information and concentrates on the most important criteria, making it easier to understand and act upon.

- Actionable: The revised prompt includes actionable steps.  A recipe writer knows exactly what specifics to provide, such as measures, baking temperature, and time, making it easier to prepare the recipe right away.

 -Measurable: The needs are measurable.  For example, the recipe must feed 12 people, contain precise measurements, and specify the baking temperature and time.  These are distinct, measurable results that can be tracked and verified.


- Contextual: The updated prompt specifies the type of food (traditional chocolate chip cookie) and desired texture (soft and chewy).  This aids in the development of a recipe that is personalized to the desired goal while also providing a better user experience for individuals who follow the recipe.
